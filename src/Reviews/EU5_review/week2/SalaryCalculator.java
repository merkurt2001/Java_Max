/*
write a program that can calculate the tax, salary & salary after tax based on 
the hourly rate & tax rate

                ex:
                         rate = 50;
                        taxRate = 0.3;  
                        weeklyHours = 40;

                    then output will be:
                            your salary is: 96000 USD
                            your total tax is: 28800 USD
                            your income after tax is: 67200 USD

                Assume that a year has 48 weeks (excluding PTO)

Week13 Review Topics:
			OOP Encapsulation: private, getter/setter
			Static members: static variables, static methods, static blocks


OOP: object oreinted programming

		4 concepts:
				1. Encapsulation
				2. Inheritance
				3. Abstraction
				4. Polymorphism



Encapsulation: data hiding
			1. hiding the data by giving private access modifier

					private: only visible within the class

			2. generate public getter/setter to read/write the data

						getter(read only): public instance method ( return)


						setter(write ONLY): public instance method (void)


using the data:
		1. read
		2. write



instance (multiple copies): belongs to the object, can be called through object
		
		each object has its own copy of instance


Static (one copy ONLY): belong to the class, can be called through the class name
				
				all the objects have the same copy 





class Employee{
	name, jobtitle, salary
}

	employee1: john, "SDET", 100000
	employee2: Daniel, Developer, 120000



class Circle{
	r
	PI = 3.14
}


class Iphone{
	instance: model, color, price
	static: brand, operatingSystem, isTouchScreen

}

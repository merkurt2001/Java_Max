OOP: Object Oreinted Programming
	A design pattern of the applications in an organized and modular way

	increases reusability
	less codes
	less memoryy usage
	clear structure
	Flexiblity
	easy to maintain


	Encapsulation: data hiding

	Inheritance: building IS A relationships between classes

	Abstraction: hiding the implementations/details of the method

	Polymorphism: objects taking on many forms

		WebDriver  driver = new FireFoxDriver();
						    new ChromeDriver();
						    ...

Exception: unexpected or unwanted event

	unchecked (unexpected): runtime exceptions
	
	checked (unwanted event): compile time exceptions


Exception Handlings: 

	1. try & catch blocks: can handle both checked and unchecked exceptions

			try{
				exception code
			}catch(ExceptionType e){
				e.printStackTrace(); // gives the details of the exceptions without causing impacrt to the execution result
			}finally{
				statements 
			}

			how to stop finally block from being executed?
					System.exit(0);


	2. throws keyword: can ONLY handle checked exception

					the caller of the method will be responsible for the exception

throw: used for manually throws an exception

Week12 Review Topics:
			Constructors
			ArrayList
			ArrayList vs Array
			Collections Utility


methods: to create a function
	
	syntax:
		Access-Modifier  Specifier  returnType  methodName(parameter){
				statements;
		}

		Access Modifier: public
							public: always accessible

		Specifier: static
							static: can be called through class name

		returnType: void/any datatype
				void: does not return any data 
				dataType: MUSt return a data

		Parameter: any DataType



Constructor: special method. used for instantiate/create an object
			
			execution of the constructor ALWAYS depends on the object (we can use it to set instances)

			Every class MUST have

		syntax:
			Access-Modifier  ClassName(Parameter){
					statemnts;
			}



object: instances need to be called through the object
	syntax:
		new ExistingConstructor

instance (multiple copies): each object has its own copy

static (one copy): all the objects they have the smae copy

this: refers to the object instances
	this.: used for calling instance variable & instance methods

			we use it call the instance variable if a local variable having the same name as instance variable

	this(): used for calling the constructor


Dog:
	Attributes (instance variables):
		name, breed, age, gender

	Action (instance methods):
		eat(), drink(), sleep(), bark()


3 data structures:
		1. Array: supports primitves & non-primitives. fixed size
		2. Collection: ONLY supports non-primitives. dynamic size
		3. Map: pairs of Data, ONLY supports non-primitives. dynamic size



ArrayList: Part of Collection. internally uses array. 
			has index numbers
